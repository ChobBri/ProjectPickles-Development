                    <h2>A long overdue update</h2>
                    <p>It's been about a little less than 4 months since I did anything with this project. There are many reasons for this which I will bring up in this post.</p>

                    <p>On January 11, 2022, around 11 pm, the sprinkler pipe burst which lead to my whole room getting flooded. I won't get into the details, but for the next 3 weeks,
                        I needed to stay at a hotel for a place to sleep and use internet and also walk back and forth between the hotel and my place to deal with the flood damage.
                        This was all the while trying to keep up with school. Basically, I was forced to put this project on hiatus whether I wanted to or not.
                    </p>

                    <p>The question is why I didn't come back to this project after those 3 weeks? I think the 3 reasons I can think off the top of my head are:
                        probably because I was exhausted from having to deal with the flood damage,
                        because of the school workload, and because I was already making a game for a course. There's also the fourth reason that I didn't want to go back
                        to the spaghetti code I've written after not having touched it for months.
                    </p>

                    <h2>Future of this project</h2>
                    <p>This post is probably my final post, but this is only because I hope to do a complete reset of this project.
                        I'm hoping to actually make a clean functional blogpost webpage as opposed to the current one I have right now.
                        Now that I have a decent grasp of Unity, I hope to experiment more with that first before going back to the Monogame Framework.
